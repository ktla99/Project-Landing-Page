                <div class="boxes1">I have a crazy obsession with animals, but more specifically those of the avian family. Growing up, I adored animals and watched shows in abundance in relations to the wildlife as much as I could. Growing up, I hope to one day assist in the preservation of endangered bird species and have a bird sanctuary of my own!</div>
                <div class="boxes2">At a young age, the skies have held a fascination in me, which continues to grow the older I get. Seeing the stars in person is a dream that I often fantasize about as I am easily intrigued by the unknown. Random note, I do not know how to swim as of yet, and I believe I might need to take swimming lessons before I can even think about traveling to space.</div>
                <div class="boxes3">Traveling to many different countries is a typical, but exciting goal that I look forward to. I have never really traveled much further than my own state and often get tired from the mundaneness of it all. But if I could travel to places with wildly different environment and wildlife, then I would send the time to enjoy and immerse myself in their cultures.</div>
                <div class="boxes4">Even though I have many goals of trying new experiences and traveling, I find myself most comfortable at home and spending time enjoying what the fast pace world has to offer me over the web and various of medias.</div>
